== Microservices with Spring Boot

_45 MINUTE EXERCISE_

In this lab you will learn about Spring Boot and how you can build microservices 
using Spring Boot and JBoss technologies. During this lab, you will create a REST API for 
the Catalog service in order to provide a list of products for the CoolStore online shop.

Spring Boot is an opinionated framework that makes it easy to create stand-alone Spring based 
applications with embedded web containers such as Tomcat (or JBoss Web Server), Jetty and Undertow 
that you can run directly on the JVM using **java -jar**. Spring Boot also allows producing a war 
file that can be deployed on stand-alone web containers.

The opinionated approach means many choices about Spring platform and third-party libraries 
are already made by Spring Boot so that you can get started with minimum effort and configuration.

=== Spring Boot Maven Project 

The **catalog-spring-boot** project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the Spring Boot project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

Once loaded, you should see the following files and be able to navigate amongst the files. The 
components of the Spring Boot project are laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

This is a minimal Spring Boot project with support for RESTful services and Spring Data with JPA for connecting
to a database. This project currently contains no code other than the main class, ***CatalogApplication***
which is there to bootstrap the Spring Boot application.

`*Examine 'com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog.CatalogApplication' class*` in the **/projects/labs/catalog-spring-boot/src/main** directory:

[source,java]
.CatalogApplication.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;
import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class CatalogApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(CatalogApplication.class, args);
    }
}
----

The database is configured using the Spring application configuration file which is located at 
**/projects/labs/catalog-spring-boot/src/main/resources/application.properties**. Examine this file to see the database connection details 
and note that an in-memory H2 database is used in this lab for local development and will be replaced
with a PostgreSQL database in the following labs. Be patient! More on that later.

You can use Maven to make sure the skeleton project builds successfully. 

To build and deploy the **Catalog Service** on OpenShift using the *fabric8* maven plugin, 
which is already configured in CodeReady Workspaces: `*right click on 'catalog-spring-boot'*` project in the project explorer then, `*click on 'Commands > Build > build'*`

You should get a **BUILD SUCCESS** message in the build logs, otherwise the build has failed.

image:{% image_path codeready-commands-build.png %}[Maven Build,600]

Once successfully built, the resulting ***jar*** is located in the **target/** directory:

----
$ ls /projects/labs/catalog-spring-boot/target/*.jar

/projects/labs/catalog-spring-boot/target/catalog-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

This is an uber-jar with all the dependencies required packaged in the ***jar*** to enable running the 
application with **java -jar**.

Now that the project is ready, let's get coding and create a domain model, data repository, and a  
RESTful endpoint to create the Catalog service:

image:{% image_path springboot-catalog-arch.png %}[Catalog RESTful Service,640]

=== Create the Domain Model

Create a new Java class named ***Product*** in the ***com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog*** package with the below code and 
following fields: ***itemId*** ***name*** ***desc*** and ***price***

In the project explorer in CodeReady Workspaces, 
`*right-click on 'catalog-spring-boot/src/main/java/com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog'*`
then `*click on 'New > Java Class'*`. `*Enter 'Product'*` as the Java class name.

[source,java]
.Product.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import java.io.Serializable;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint;

@Entity // <1>
@Table(name = "PRODUCT", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "itemId")) // <2>
public class Product implements Serializable {
  
  @Id // <3>
  private String itemId;
  
  private String name;
  
  private String description;
  
  private double price;

  public Product() {
  }
  
  public String getItemId() {
    return itemId;
  }

  public void setItemId(String itemId) {
    this.itemId = itemId;
  }

  public String getName() {
    return name;
  }

  public void setName(String name) {
    this.name = name;
  }

  public String getDescription() {
    return description;
  }

  public void setDescription(String description) {
    this.description = description;
  }

  public double getPrice() {
    return price;
  }

  public void setPrice(double price) {
    this.price = price;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Product [itemId=" + itemId + ", name=" + name + ", price=" + price + "]";
  }
}
----
<1> **@Entity** marks the class as a JPA entity
<2> **@Table** customizes the table creation process by defining a table name and database constraint
<3> **@Id** marks the primary key for the table

=== Create a Data Repository

Spring Data repository abstraction simplifies dealing with data models in Spring applications by 
reducing the amount of boilerplate code required to implement data access layers for various 
persistence stores. https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/jpa/docs/current/reference/html/#repositories.core-concepts[Repository and its sub-interfaces^] 
are the central concept in Spring Data which is a marker interface to provide 
data manipulation functionality for the entity class that is being managed. When the application starts, 
Spring finds all interfaces marked as repositories and for each interface found, the infrastructure 
configures the required persistent technologies and provides an implementation for the repository interface.

Create a new Java interface named *_ProductRepository_* in ***com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog*** package 
and extend https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/commons/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/repository/CrudRepository.html[CrudRepository^] interface in order to indicate to Spring that you want to expose a complete set of methods to manipulate the entity.

In the project explorer in CodeReady Workspaces, `*right-click on 'catalog-spring-boot/src/main/java/com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog'*` 
then `*click on 'New > Java Class*` and paste the following code:

[source,java]
.ProductRepository.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import org.springframework.data.repository.CrudRepository;

public interface ProductRepository extends CrudRepository<Product, String> {
}
----

That's it! Now that you have a domain model and a repository to retrieve the domain model, 
let's create a RESTful service that returns the list of products.

=== Create a RESTful Service

Spring Boot uses Spring Web MVC as the default RESTful stack in Spring applications. Create 
a new Java class named ***CatalogController*** in ***com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog*** package with 
the following content by `*right-clicking on 'catalog-spring-boot/src/main/java/com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog'*` and 
then `*click on 'New > Java Class'*`:

[source,java]
.CatalogController.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.catalog;

import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.http.MediaType;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.*;

@Controller
@RequestMapping(value = "/api/catalog")
public class CatalogController {
    @Autowired
    private ProductRepository repository;

    @ResponseBody
    @GetMapping(produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE)
    public List<Product> getAll() {
        Spliterator<Product> products = repository.findAll().spliterator();
        return StreamSupport.stream(products, false).collect(Collectors.toList());
    }
}
----

The above REST service defines an endpoint that is accessible via **HTTP GET** at **/api/catalog**. Notice 
the **repository** field on the controller class which is used to retrieve the list of products. Spring Boot 
automatically provides an implementation for ***ProductRepository*** at runtime and 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/using-boot-spring-beans-and-dependency-injection.html[injects it into the controller using the ***@Autowire*** annotation^].

Build and package the ***Catalog Service*** using Maven by `*right clicking on 'catalog-spring-boot'*` project in the project explorer then, `*click on 'Commands > Build > build'*`

image:{% image_path codeready-commands-build.png %}[Maven Build,600]

Using Spring Boot maven plugin, you can conveniently run the application in CodeReady Workspaces and 
test the endpoint. In CodeReady Workspaces, `*click on the run icon and then on 'spring-boot:run'*`. 

image:{% image_path run-icon-springboot.png %}[Run Icon - Spring Boot,200]

TIP: You can also run the ***Catalog Service*** in CodeReady Workspaces using the *_Commands Palette_* and then **RUN > spring-boot:run**
 
When you see **Started CatalogApplication** in the logs, you can access the 
Catalog REST API. Letâ€™s test it out using `*curl*` in a new terminal window:

----
$ curl http://localhost:9000/api/catalog

[{"itemId":"329299","name":"Red Fedora","desc":"Official Red Hat Fedora","price":34.99},...]
----

You can also use the preview url that CodeReady Workspaces has generated for you to be able to test the service 
that is now running in the workspace directly in the browser. 
Append the path **/api/catalog** at the end of the preview url and try it in your browser in a new tab.

image:{% image_path springboot-che-preview-browser.png %}[Preview URL,900]

The REST API returned a JSON object representing the product list. Congratulations!

Stop the Inventory service by `*clicking on the stop icon*` near **run spring-boot** in the **Machines** window.

image:{% image_path springboot-che-stop.png %}[Stop Icon - Spring Boot,200]


=== Deploy Spring Boot on OpenShift

Itâ€™s time to build and deploy our service on OpenShift. 

OpenShift {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)^] 
feature can be used to build a container image from your project. OpenShift 
S2I uses the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_java_s2i_for_openshift[supported OpenJDK container image^] to build the final container image 
of the **Catalog Service** by uploading the Spring Boot uber-jar from the **target/** 
folder to the OpenShift platform. 

Maven projects can use the https://maven.fabric8.io[Fabric8 Maven Plugin^] to access the OpenShift S2I for building the application container image. 
This maven plugin is a Kubernetes/OpenShift client and uses the REST API to communicate with OpenShift and issue commands to build, 
deploy and launch the application as a pod.

To build and deploy the **Catalog Service** on OpenShift using the *fabric8* maven plugin, 
which is already configured in CodeReady Workspaces, `*right click on catalog-spring-boot*` project in the project explorer then, `*click on Commands > Deploy > fabric8:deploy*`

image:{% image_path codeready-commands-deploy.png %}[Fabric8 Deploy,600]

[TIP]
.fabric8:deploy
====
It will cause the following to happen:

* The Catalog uber-jar is built using Spring Boot
* A container image is built on OpenShift containing the Catalog uber-jar and JDK
* All necessary objects are created within the OpenShift project to deploy the Catalog service
====

Once this completes, your project should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of 
the project in one or more pods which are the unit of runtime deployment and consists of the running 
containers for the project. 

Let's take a moment and review the OpenShift resources that are created for the Catalog REST API:

* **Build Config**: *catalog-s2i* build config is the configuration for building the Catalog 
container image from the catalog source code or JAR archive
* **Image Stream**: *catalog* image stream is the virtual view of all catalog container 
images built and pushed to the OpenShift integrated registry.
* **Deployment Config**: *catalog* deployment config deploys and redeploys the Catalog container 
image whenever a new Catalog container image becomes available
* **Service**: *catalog* service is an internal load balancer which identifies a set of 
pods (containers) in order to proxy the connections it receives to them. Backing pods can be 
added to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the service remains consistently available, 
enabling anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent address (service name 
or IP).
* **Route**: *catalog* route registers the service on the built-in external load-balancer 
and assigns a public DNS name to it so that it can be reached from outside OpenShift cluster.

You can review the above resources in the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^] or using `*oc describe*` command:

TIP: **bc** is the short-form of **buildconfig** and can be interchangeably used instead of it with the 
OpenShift CLI. The same goes for **is** instead of **imagestream**, **dc** instead of **deploymentconfig** 
and **svc** instead of **service**.

----
$ oc describe bc catalog-s2i
$ oc describe is catalog
$ oc describe dc catalog
$ oc describe svc catalog
$ oc describe route catalog
----

You can see the expose DNS url for the ***Catalog Service*** in the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^] or using 
OpenShift CLI.

----
$ oc get routes

NAME        HOST/PORT                                       PATH        SERVICES        PORT        TERMINATION   
catalog     catalog-{{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}.{{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX}}                      catalog         8080        None
inventory   inventory-{{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}.{{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX}}                    inventory       8080        None
----

`*Click on the OpenShift Route of _'Catalog Service'_*` from the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^].

image:{% image_path catalog-service.png %}[Catalog Service,500]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
[{"itemId":"329299","name":"Red Fedora","desc":"Official Red Hat Fedora","price":34.99},...]
----

Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
