Java EE applications are traditionally created as an *ear* or *war* archive including all 
dependencies and deployed in an application server. Multiple Java EE applications can and 
were typically deployed in the same application server. This model is well understood in 
development teams and has been used over the past several years.

https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail^] offers an innovative approach to packaging and running Java EE applications by 
packaging them with just enough of the Java EE server runtime to be able to run them directly 
on the JVM using `*java -jar`. For more details on various approaches to packaging Java 
applications, read https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2017/08/24/the-skinny-on-fat-thin-hollow-and-uber[this blog post^].

https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail^] is based on WildFly and it's compatible with 
https://microprofile.io/[MicroProfile^], which is a community effort to standardize the subset of Java EE standards 
such as JAX-RS, CDI and JSON-P that are useful for building microservices applications.

Since https://thorntail.io/[Thorntail^] is based on Java EE standards, it significantly simplifies refactoring 
existing Java EE applications to microservices and allows much of the existing code-base to be 
reused in the new services.

=== Thorntail Maven Project 

The **inventory-thorntail** project has the following structure which shows the components of 
the Thorntail project laid out in different subdirectories according to Maven best practices:

image:{% image_path thorntail-inventory-project.png %}[Inventory Project,200]

This is a minimal Java EE project with support for JAX-RS for building RESTful services and JPA for connecting
to a database. https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/jaxrs.htm[JAX-RS^] is one of Java EE standards that uses Java annotations to simplify 
the development of RESTful web services. https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/partpersist.htm[Java Persistence API (JPA)^] is another Java EE 
standard that provides Java developers with an object/relational mapping facility for managing relational data in Java applications.

This project currently contains no code other than the main class for exposing a single 
RESTful application defined in **InventoryApplication**. 

`*Examine 'com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory.InventoryApplication' class*` in the **/projects/labs/inventory-thorntail/src/main/java** directory:

[source,java]
.InventoryApplication.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;

@ApplicationPath("/api")
public class InventoryApplication extends Application {
}
----

Run the Maven build to make sure the skeleton project builds successfully. You should get a **BUILD SUCCESS** message 
in the build logs, otherwise the build has failed.

In CodeReady Workspaces, `*right-click on 'inventory-thorntail'*` project in the project explorer then, `*click on 'Commands > Build > build'*`

image:{% image_path codeready-commands-build.png %}[Maven Build,600]

Once built successfully, the resulting *jar* is located in the **target/** directory:

----
$ ls /projects/labs/inventory-thorntail/target/*-thorntail.jar
/projects/labs/inventory-thorntail/target/inventory-1.0-SNAPSHOT-thorntail.jar
----

This is an uber-jar with all the dependencies required packaged in the *jar* to enable running the 
application with **java -jar**. Thorntail also creates a *war* packaging as a standard Java EE web app 
that could be deployed to any Java EE app server (for example, JBoss EAP, or its upstream WildFly project).  

Now let's write some code and create a domain model and a RESTful endpoint to create the Inventory service:

image:{% image_path wfswarm-inventory-arch.png %}[Inventory RESTful Service,500]

=== Creating a Domain Model

Create a new Java class named **Inventory** in **com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory** package with the below code and 
following fields: **itemId** and **quantity**

In the project explorer in CodeReady Workspaces, `*right-click on 'inventory-thorntail > src > main > java > com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory'*` 
and then `*click on 'New > Java Class'*`. `*Enter 'Inventory'*` as the Java class name.

image:{% image_path wfswarm-inventory-che-new-class.png %}[CodeReady Workspaces - Create Java Class,700]

[source,java]
.Inventory.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint;
import java.io.Serializable;

@Entity // <1>
@Table(name = "INVENTORY", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "itemId")) // <2>
public class Inventory implements Serializable {
    @Id // <3>
    private String itemId;

    private int quantity;

    public Inventory() {
    }

    public String getItemId() {
        return itemId;
    }

    public void setItemId(String itemId) {
        this.itemId = itemId;
    }

    public int getQuantity() {
        return quantity;
    }

    public void setQuantity(int quantity) {
        this.quantity = quantity;
    }

    @Override
    public String toString() {
        return "Inventory [itemId='" + itemId + '\'' + ", quantity=" + quantity + ']';
    }
}
----
<1> **@Entity** marks the class as a JPA entity
<2> **@Table** customizes the table creation process by defining a table name and database constraint
<3> **@Id** marks the primary key for the table

You don't need to press a save button! CodeReady Workspaces automatically saves the changes made to the files.

Thorntail configuration is done to a large extent through detecting the intent of the 
developer and automatically adding the required dependencies configurations to make sure it can 
get out of the way and developers can be productive with their code rather than Googling for 
configuration snippets. As an example, configuration database access with JPA is composed of 
the following steps:

1. The **io.thorntail:jpa** dependency to **pom.xml** 
2. The database driver (e.g. **org.postgresql:postgresql**) to **pom.xml**
3. The database connection details in **/projects/labs/inventory-thorntail/src/main/resources/project-default.yml**

`*Edit the 'pom.xml' file*` and add the **io.thorntail:jpa** dependency to enable JPA:

[source,xml]
.pom.xml
----
[...]
</dependencyManagement>
<dependencies>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
        <artifactId>jpa</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
        <artifactId>jaxrs-jsonp</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.thorntail</groupId>
        <artifactId>cdi</artifactId>
    </dependency>
    [...]
</dependencies>
<build>
[...]
----

`*Examine 'src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml'*` to see the JPA datasource configuration 
for this project. Also note that the configurations uses **META-INF/load.sql** to import 
initial data into the database.

`*Examine 'src/main/resources/project-default.yml'*` to see the database connection details. 
An in-memory H2 database is used in this lab for local development and in the following 
labs will be replaced with a PostgreSQL database. Be patient! More on that later.

=== Creating a RESTful Service

Thorntail uses JAX-RS standard for building REST services. In the project explorer in CodeReady Workspaces, `*right-click on 'inventory-thorntail > src > main > java > com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory'*` 
and then `*click on 'New > Java Class'*`. `*Enter 'InventoryResource'*` as the Java class name.

[source,java]
.InventoryResource.java
----
package com.redhat.cloudnative.inventory;

import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import javax.persistence.*;
import javax.ws.rs.*;
import javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType;

@Path("/inventory")
@ApplicationScoped
public class InventoryResource {
    @PersistenceContext(unitName = "InventoryPU")
    private EntityManager em;

    @GET
    @Path("/{itemId}")
    @Produces(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
    public Inventory getAvailability(@PathParam("itemId") String itemId) {
        Inventory inventory = em.find(Inventory.class, itemId);
        return inventory;
    }
}
----

The above REST service defines an endpoint that is accessible via **HTTP GET** at 
for example **/api/inventory/329299** with 
the last path param being the product id which we want to check its inventory status.

Build and package the ***Inventory Service*** using Maven by `*right clicking on 'inventory-thorntail'*` project in the project explorer 
then, `*click on 'Commands > Build > build'*`

image:{% image_path codeready-commands-build.png %}[Maven Build,600]

IMPORTANT: Make sure **inventory-thorntail** project is highlighted in the project explorer

Using CodeReady Workspaces and Thorntail maven plugin, you can conveniently run the application
directly in the IDE and test it before deploying it on OpenShift.

In CodeReady Workspaces, `*click on the run icon and then on 'thorntail:run'*`. 

image:{% image_path run-icon-thorntail.png %}[Run Icon - Thorntail,200]

TIP: You can also run the ***Inventory Service*** in CodeReady Workspaces using the *_Commands Palette_* and then **RUN > thorntail:run**


Once you see **Thorntail is Ready** in the logs, the ***Inventory Service***  is up and running and you can access the 
inventory REST API. Letâ€™s test it out using `*curl*` in the **Terminal** window:

----
$ curl http://localhost:9001/api/inventory/329299

{"itemId":"329299","quantity":35}
----

You can also use the preview url that CodeReady Workspaces has generated for you to be able to test the service 
that is now running in the workspace directly in the browser. 
Append the path **/api/inventory/329299** at the end of the preview url and try it in your browser in a new tab.

image:{% image_path thorntail-inventory-codeready-preview-url.png %}[Preview URL,900]

image:{% image_path wfswarm-inventory-che-preview-browser.png %}[Preview URL,900]


The REST API returned a JSON object representing the inventory count for this product. Congratulations!

In CodeReady Workspaces, stop the Inventory service by clicking on the **run thorntail** item in the **Machines** window. Then click the stop icon that appears next to **run thorntail**.

image:{% image_path thorntail-inventory-codeready-run-stop.png %}[Preview URL,600]

=== Deploy Thorntail on OpenShift

Itâ€™s time to build and deploy our service on OpenShift. 

OpenShift {{OPENSHIFT_DOCS_BASE}}/architecture/core_concepts/builds_and_image_streams.html#source-build[Source-to-Image (S2I)^] 
feature can be used to build a container image from your project. OpenShift 
S2I uses the https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_jboss_middleware_for_openshift/3/html/red_hat_java_s2i_for_openshift[supported OpenJDK container image^] to build the final container image of the 
Inventory service by uploading the Thorntail uber-jar from the **target** folder to 
the OpenShift platform.

Maven projects can use the https://maven.fabric8.io[Fabric8 Maven Plugin^] to access the OpenShift S2I for building the application container image. 
This maven plugin is a Kubernetes/OpenShift client and uses the REST API to communicate with OpenShift and issue commands to build, 
deploy and launch the application as a pod.

To build and deploy the **Inventory Service** on OpenShift using the *fabric8* maven plugin, 
which is already configured in CodeReady Workspaces, `*right click on 'inventory-thorntail'*` project in the project explorer 
then, `*click on 'Commands > Deploy > fabric8:deploy'*`

image:{% image_path codeready-commands-deploy.png %}[Fabric8 Deploy,600]

[NOTE]
====
If you have a failure during this step, make sure you are properly authenticate on OpenShift from your workspace:
`$ oc login {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}`
and then on the right project:
$ oc project {{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}
====

[TIP]
.fabric8:deploy
====
It will cause the following to happen:

* The Inventory uber-jar is built using Thorntail
* A container image is built on OpenShift containing the Inventory uber-jar and JDK
* All necessary objects are created within the OpenShift project to deploy the Inventory service
====

Once this completes, your project should be up and running. OpenShift runs the different components of 
the project in one or more pods which are the unit of runtime deployment and consists of the running 
containers for the project. 

Let's take a moment and review the OpenShift resources that are created for the Inventory REST API:

* **Build Config**: **inventory-s2i** build config is the configuration for building the Inventory 
container image from the inventory source code or JAR archive
* **Image Stream**: **inventory** image stream is the virtual view of all inventory container 
images built and pushed to the OpenShift integrated registry.
* **Deployment Config**: **inventory** deployment config deploys and redeploys the Inventory container 
image whenever a new Inventory container image becomes available
* **Service**: **inventory** service is an internal load balancer which identifies a set of 
pods (containers) in order to proxy the connections it receives to them. Backing pods can be 
added to or removed from a service arbitrarily while the service remains consistently available, 
enabling anything that depends on the service to refer to it at a consistent address (service name 
or IP).
* **Route**: **inventory** route registers the service on the built-in external load-balancer 
and assigns a public DNS name to it so that it can be reached from outside OpenShift cluster.

You can review the above resources in the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^] or using **oc describe** command:

TIP:  **bc** is the short-form of **buildconfig** and can be interchangeably used 
instead of it with the OpenShift CLI. The same goes for **is** instead 
of **imagestream`, **dc** instead of **deploymentconfig** and **svc** instead of **service`.

----
$ oc describe bc inventory-s2i
$ oc describe is inventory
$ oc describe dc inventory
$ oc describe svc inventory
$ oc describe route inventory
----

You can see the exposed DNS url for the Inventory service in the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^] or using 
OpenShift CLI:

----
$ oc get routes

NAME        HOST/PORT                                        PATH       SERVICES  PORT  TERMINATION   
inventory   inventory-{{COOLSTORE_PROJECT}}.{{APPS_HOSTNAME_SUFFIX}}   inventory  8080            None
----

`*Click on the OpenShift Route of _'Inventory Service'_*` from the {{OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_URL}}[OpenShift Web Console^].

image:{% image_path inventory-service.png %}[Inventory Service,500]

Then `*click on 'Test it'*`. You should have the following output:

[source,json]
----
{"itemId":"329299","quantity":35}
----


Well done! You are ready to move on to the next lab.
